Dan Gheesling is a renowned personality who first gained fame as a contestant on the CBS reality show.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=553 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>To this day, there is little doubt that Gheesling, born on 1 September 1983, has left an indelible mark on the&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;universe, inspiring future candidates with his excellent tactical skills and raising the bar for the show to new heights. This brilliant strategist and skilled manipulator originally appeared in&nbsp;Big Brother 10, then returned with a vengeance in&nbsp;Big Brother 14. Throughout his two stints on the show, Dan Gheesling’s play was spectacular, capturing the audience and leaving his opponents frustrated.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-big-brother-10-the-rise-of-a-mastermind data-injectable=false>Big Brother 10&nbsp;– The rise of a mastermind&nbsp;</h2><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>In the summer of 2008, viewers of&nbsp;Big Brother 10&nbsp;were introduced to a young, modest Catholic school teacher by the name of Dan Gheesling. Dan was immediately evident as a master of group dynamics and strategic play. He bonded deeply with his housemates fast and masterfully navigated secret relationships. One of Dan’s first and most crucial acts was joining forces with Memphis Garrett in a Final Two alliance, which ultimately proved to be a cornerstone of his eventual victory.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=864 data-injectable=true>At several points in the season, Dan showed an extraordinary ability to influence people’s impressions of him, appearing to be a non-threatening player while actually tugging the strings. In a memorable moment, Dan orchestrated a live “funeral” for himself during the game, tricking his fellow houseguests into thinking he was giving up. However, this was all a carefully orchestrated scheme to sow confusion and uncertainty among the competing groups. This bold action prevented his eviction and cemented his status as a cunning tactician.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Strategically, Dan’s brilliance shone even brighter as the season wound down. He was able to avoid elimination after elimination, demonstrating his ability to avoid being targeted as a serious threat by the other competitors. Dan’s outstanding gameplay paid off in the end, and he was voted&nbsp;Big Brother 10&nbsp;winner by a unanimous jury. This triumph cemented Dan’s status as one of the show’s best winners.</p><h2 id=h-big-brother-14-the-second-coming data-injectable=false>Big Brother 14&nbsp;– The second coming&nbsp;</h2><p data-characters=686 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Dan Gheesling returned to&nbsp;Big Brother 14&nbsp;as a coach four years after his epic victory in&nbsp;Big Brother 10, alongside fellow famous players Britney Haynes, Mike “Boogie” Malin, and Janelle Pierzina. This time, though, Dan was presented with a new challenge: he had to coach a team of fresh players while attempting to protect his path to the end. Early on in the season, Dan’s coaching prowess was on full display as he led his squad to victory. But Dan saw his chance to regain control when the coaches were allowed to participate as regular players. He plotted a surprise attack on his fellow coach Janelle and allied himself with the other house guests.</p><p data-characters=574 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>All season long on&nbsp;Big Brother 14, Dan was revealed to be the show’s master manipulator, working behind the scenes to establish complex alliances with other contestants. His mastery of the eviction process and ability to persuade others to make moves for him became legendary. Perhaps Dan’s most infamous move in&nbsp;Big Brother 14&nbsp;was “Dan’s Funeral 2.0,” a callback to his previous season’s funeral. Facing almost certain eviction, he once again staged a dramatic last-ditch effort to sway the house’s perception.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Dan was able to flip the house with the help of some well-placed lies and some tearful pleading. Dan Gheesling was relegated to the Final Two as the season neared its climax, but this time he was seated next to his comrade, Ian Terry. Ian was a formidable opponent, so the jury, impressed by Dan’s strategic prowess, opted to give him second place. Dan’s performance on&nbsp;Big Brother 14&nbsp;cemented his legendary reputation in the game, even though he fell just short of being the first two-time champion.</p><h2 id=h-life-after-big-brother data-injectable=false>Life after&nbsp;Big Brother</h2><p data-characters=624 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Dan Gheesling’s talents now go well beyond reality television. After Big Brother, he dove headfirst into the developing world of online content creation and entrepreneurship, quickly becoming a prominent figure. Gheesling has used the charisma and innovative thinking he developed on&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;to launch a successful career as a video creator on Twitch and YouTube. Concentrating on video games, he has amassed a devoted fan base for Minecraft, Among Us, and the Dark Souls series. His distinctive strategic, analytical gaming is showcased in a friendly, inclusive setting on his Twitch streams and YouTube videos.</p><p data-characters=657 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>Gheesling’s career path after Big Brother also included forays into the fields of mentoring and self-improvement. He wrote several self-help books based on his time in and out of the&nbsp;Big Brother&nbsp;house. Books like&nbsp;Punch It In: 10 Winning Tactics from the Field to the Boardroom&nbsp;and&nbsp;Clean Your Own Mirror: 6 Necessary Duties to Lead and Influence People&nbsp;have been praised for their straightforward, actionable guidance on leadership and personal development. Because of his personality and life experiences, Gheesling’s writing rings true for many people. His enterprising energy did not end with writing books.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=649 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>To provide his community with a complete gaming environment, Gheesling founded Gheesling Gaming Group. The company hosts online gaming competitions, oversees a merchandising line, and offers one-on-one tutoring for aspiring content creators. While his business life continues to flourish, Gheesling’s personal life has been equally fulfilling. He lives with his wife, Chelsea, and their two children in Michigan. Though he keeps much of his personal life private, Gheesling occasionally gives peeks into his family life on social media, revealing a guy who cherishes his role as a father and spouse as much as his professional endeavors.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-will-dan-gheesling-be-returning-to-big-brother data-injectable=false>Will Dan Gheesling be returning to&nbsp;Big Brother?</h2><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=false>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly,</a> Dan made it clear that he has moved on from his reality TV days and is now focusing on his family. Dan has returned to coaching football and aims to utilize his celebrity status to help others. So, as much as viewers would love to see Dan Gheesling back on&nbsp;Big Brother,&nbsp;it seems unlikely he will. Fans can continue interacting with him through his various online projects and social media pages.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpJqmqWLBqrnErGShmaNisaK6jKCfnp2jobavs4ybnJ6mXaS7bq7IoGSbqp%2Bptaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-dan-gheesling-been-on-big-brother.html&text=How%20many%20times%20has%20Dan%20Gheesling%20been%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-many-times-has-dan-gheesling-been-on-big-brother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-dan-gheesling-been-on-big-brother.html&title=How%20many%20times%20has%20Dan%20Gheesling%20been%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-dan-gheesling-been-on-big-brother.html&title=How%20many%20times%20has%20Dan%20Gheesling%20been%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-dan-gheesling-been-on-big-brother.html&title=How%20many%20times%20has%20Dan%20Gheesling%20been%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-dan-gheesling-been-on-big-brother.html&description=How%20many%20times%20has%20Dan%20Gheesling%20been%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-no-301-trey-upset-with-no-278-ashley-for-the-glass-bridge-controversy-in-squid-game-the-challenge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is No. 301 Trey upset with No. 278 Ashley for the Glass Bridge controversy in Squid Game: The Cha">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./beautiful-o-b.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beautiful O.B">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
