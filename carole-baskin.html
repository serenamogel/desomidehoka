However, it was the popular docuseries Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness (2020) that transformed Baskin into a public figure. The program showcased tensions between Baskin and Joe Exotic, a private zoo owner who Baskin <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/state-courts-tigers-lawsuits-courts-archive-8e040f580300f2a669f0f46db6f73660 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="believed was mistreating his animals" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">believed was mistreating his animals</a>. Tiger King also brought new attention to the 1997 disappearance of Baskin's second husband, which remains an open case. Thanks to her post-Tiger King celebrity, Baskin joined the lineup of Dancing with the Stars in September 2020; her cat-themed performances were not a hit and she became the second contestant to be eliminated.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Baskin was born as Carole Stairs on June 6, 1961, at the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Introduction to Animal Activism and Big Cat Rescue</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Baskin entered into the world of big cats when her second husband Don Lewis gave her a 6-month-old bobcat in 1992. A visit to a fur farm resulted in the couple acquiring more than fifty additional bobcat kittens; these were followed by many other animals. In time Baskin and Lewis were caring for two hundred big cats on a 40-acre sanctuary in Tampa, Florida, which had a bed and breakfast where visitors could interact with the cats. They called it Wildlife on East Street.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Baskin and Lewis were rescuing animals, they also sold and bred big cats. But when Baskin's interest in animal rights made her object to this practice, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/joe-exotic-and-his-american-animals.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she found herself at odds with Lewis" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">she found herself at odds with Lewis</a>. After Lewis' disappearance, Baskin maintained control of the sanctuary and its inhabitants.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following Baskin's marriage to Howard Baskin in 2004, her nonprofit organization was renamed Big Cat Rescue. Today, Big Cat Rescue is a 69-acre animal sanctuary with spacious enclosures (the smallest is 1,200 square feet). Big Cat Rescue has welcomed visitors â€” though these visits were limited by the coronavirus pandemic â€” but does not allow them to interact with the cats there.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The organization also advocates for laws to protect big cats. Baskin wants the Big Cat Public Safety Act to go into effect; it would crack down on unscrupulous breeders and eliminate private ownership of big cats, while also preventing zoos from allowing visitors to pet and touch these animals. "We hold Big Cat Rescue and the Baskins in highest regard," a representative from the Humane Society told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida/2020/04/10/carole-and-howard-baskin-say-tiger-king-makers-betrayed-their-trust/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tampa Bay Times" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Tampa Bay Times</a> in April 2020. "Not many sanctuaries do rescue and advocacy and Big Cat Rescue does both and they do them very well."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Baskin and Joe Exotic</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2009, Baskin <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/joe-exotic-and-his-american-animals.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="became aware" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">became aware</a> that private zoo owner Joe Exotic (who has also used the names Joseph Schreibvogel and Joseph Maldonado-Passage) was bringing young tiger cubs to malls for petting visits, a practice that <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida/2020/04/10/carole-and-howard-baskin-say-tiger-king-makers-betrayed-their-trust/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="required the cubs to be prematurely separated" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">required the cubs to be prematurely separated</a> from their mothers. She and her followers started to contact these venues to push for the visits to stop. Baskin also objected to Exotic breeding and selling tigers, felt animals in his care were mistreated, and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/i-clicked-and-seven-hours-passed-netflixs-tiger-king data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wanted to close his zoo" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">wanted to close his zoo</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Exotic fought back against Baskin, at times in underhanded ways. He started to use the name of Baskin's organization to promote his zoo, which led to a trademark infringement suit. He <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5807284/tiger-king-netflix-true-story/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shared excerpts from Baskin's stolen diary" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">shared excerpts from Baskin's stolen diary</a>. He also created harassing videos, including a music video featuring a Baskin lookalike that suggested Baskin had killed her missing husband and fed his remains to her tigers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition to publicly attacking Baskin, in 2017 Exotic attempted to hire a hitman to kill his rival. He was arrested after federal authorities learned of the plan. In 2019, he received a 22-year sentence for this and other crimes. Exotic was behind bars when a judge ruled in June 2020 that control of his private zoo had been improperly transferred in an attempt to keep it from creditors. Baskin was given control of Exotic's zoo to satisfy the judgment in her trademark infringement case.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">'Tiger King'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The docuseries Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness, which became a hit when it was released during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, focused on the contentious relationship between Baskin and Exotic. The show also delved into the mystery of Baskin's missing second husband (Baskin has consistently denied any involvement in his disappearance).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Tiger King's release, Baskin accused the directors of deceptive tactics. She declared in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/tiger-king-carole-baskin-slams-netflix-documentary/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="public statement" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">public statement</a> that she'd thought the series "would expose the misery caused by the rampant breeding of big-cat cubs for cub petting exploitation and the awful life the cats lead in roadside zoos and backyards if they survive." She was disappointed because, in her view, the program had "the sole goal of being as salacious and sensational as possible to draw viewers." The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida/2020/04/10/carole-and-howard-baskin-say-tiger-king-makers-betrayed-their-trust/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="directors countered" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">directors countered</a> that Baskin had willingly spoken about her personal life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some viewers have pointed out that Tiger King <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/13/the-crass-pleasures-of-tiger-king data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="didn't favor Baskin" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">didn't favor Baskin</a> in its editing and narrative choices.

A letter Baskin had written about Murdock, in which she shared she "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tmz.com/2020/09/27/carole-baskin-letter-killed-my-husband-self-defense-joe-exotic-special-id-channel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="would have eventually killed" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">would have eventually killed</a>" her husband in order to end their marriage became public in 2020. Baskin explained she wrote those words because her husband was abusive.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1981, Baskin met Lewis following a fight with Murdock. This encounter led to an affair that lasted for several years. Baskin and Lewis got married in 1991, after divorcing their respective spouses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Baskin met Howard Baskin at a local aquarium in 2002.

Lewis' van was soon discovered at a nearby private airport. Baskin's husband had supposedly planned a trip to Costa Rica, but the investigation found no trace of Lewis there. Per Baskin, Lewis had been <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/crime/attempted-murder-target-slams-netflixs-tiger-king-as-misinformation-and-filmmakers-respond/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="seeing other women" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">seeing other women</a> and had ties to illegal activities in Costa Rica. Before vanishing Lewis had applied for a restraining order against Baskin, though he'd continued to live at home after the order was denied in June 1997.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/too-purrfect-vol-50-no-21/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1998 People magazine feature" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">1998 People magazine feature</a> about the disappearance considered the possibility that tigers from the animal rescue the couple ran had consumed Lewis' body. "It's a perfect scenario to dispose of someone," one of Lewis' daughters said in the article. "We were upset that the cops didnâ€™t test the DNA on the meat grinder." However, in 2020 the current sheriff stated that the meat grinder in question <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5813268/tiger-king-carole-baskin-don-lewis-case/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wasn't on site" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">wasn't on site</a> at the wildlife rescue when Lewis went missing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lewis was declared legally dead five years after his disappearance, and Baskin became the main beneficiary of her millionaire husband's estate. In June 2020, the sheriff confirmed that experts had determined that Lewis's will had been forged, but said <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/tiger-king-carole-baskin-husband-will-forged/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="no criminal case" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">no criminal case</a> for the forgery was possible as the statute of limitations had passed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Baskin was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/5813268/tiger-king-carole-baskin-don-lewis-case/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="asked to take a polygraph" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">asked to take a polygraph</a> in 2011, but refused on the advice of her lawyers. This left the investigation at a standstill. However, Tiger King brought new attention to the case.
