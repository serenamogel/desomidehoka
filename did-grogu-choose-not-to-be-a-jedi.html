This surprised no one – least of all Luke Skywalker.</span></span><h2>Is Grogu not going to be a Jedi?</h2>In the long run, it doesn't seem likely that he'll rejoin Skywalker Academy; Grogu is being set up to be the next Mandalorian Jedi, so he'll remain by Din's side for years to come. This will also allow him to dodge the lightning bolt The Senate uses to destroy the school decades later in The Rise of Kylo Ren.<h2>Did Grogu leave the Jedi Order?</h2>Grogu was going to be the first student that Luke ever had, and after he decided to leave, the Jedi Master likely doubted his ability to actually train a new generation of Force-users.<h2>Why did Luke give Grogu a choice?</h2>Luke made Grogu choose between Yoda's lightsaber and a Mandalorian chainmail shirt. The decision was meant to determine the course of Grogu's life -- as a Jedi or as a Mandalorian. At the time, Star Wars fans were appalled.<h2>Did Grogu make the right choice?</h2>Grogu just made the best decision of his life, and here's why. Yes, we're upset at failing to see Grogu wield a lightsaber, but we're relieved because he made the right choice. If Grogu had chosen to continue his Jedi training with Luke, it would not have been a great outcome.<h2>Why Grogu Leaves Luke Skywalker and The Jedi Explained - The Mandalorian Boba Fett</h2><p></p><h2>Does Grogu become a Sith?</h2>Not really. Grogu hasn't demonstrated any malice in the show. He has shown to be a very good character and a character that has suffered a lot. He formed a strong bond with Mando, and he consistently demonstrated that he did not want to go with the Empire.<h2>Does Luke not train Grogu?</h2>While Luke opens Grogu's mind in order to advance Grogu's Jedi training, Luke instead learns that his new student isn't ready to resume the traditional path of the Jedi, even though Grogu is clearly very attuned to the Force.<h2>What does Luke Skywalker do with Grogu?</h2>In the penultimate episode of The Book of Boba Fett, Luke gives Grogu a choice. He may take a lightsaber and further his training to become a Jedi, or he might take the protective armor that Din Djarin had crafted for him, but he would then have to rejoin the Mandalorian and forgo his training.<h2>What happens to Grogu after book of Boba Fett?</h2>The Book of Boba Fett's Season 1 finale, “In the Name of Honor” answers some big questions about the fate of Grogu. In the process, it opens a new realm of speculation when – after being offered the choice to remain with Luke Skywalker's new Jedi Order – Grogu instead decides to rejoin the Mandalorian.<h2>Will Grogu be in Obi Wan?</h2>'Star Wars' Fans Rejoice at [Spoiler'S] Appearance in 'Obi-Wan Kenobi': 'Grogu Move Over' There might be a new child in the hearts of “Star Wars” fans. With the arrival of “Obi-Wan Kenobi” on Disney+, fans have been introduced to a young Princess Leia — and of course, they promptly lost their minds.<h2>Will Grogu be in season 3 of Mandalorian?</h2>Fresh from their stealth takeover of the final episodes of “The Book of Boba Fett,” Din Djarin, aka Mando (Pedro Pascal), and his adorable companion Grogu are coming back early next year for Season 3 of “The Mandalorian.”<h2>Who were the Jedi protecting Grogu?</h2>Coleman Kcaj is a member of the Jedi Council during the latter stages of the Clone Wars. Like Oppo Rancisis, he was revealed to be one of the known survivors of Order 66 in the Darth Vader comics, meaning he could have been the one to save Grogu.<h2>Is Din Djarin Force sensitive?</h2>9 Din Djarin Is Force-Sensitive<p>But Mandalorians are trained to have Jedi-like reflexes to be able to overpower them, some of their armor and weapons even mimic Jedi abilities, like their sonic repulsors that knock objects away like a Force push.</p><h2>Did Grogu survive Kylo Ren?</h2>In the penultimate episode, we discover that Grogu is already in training with Luke Skywalker on a mysterious forest planet, having been rescued by the iconic Jedi Knight in The Mandalorian Season 2 finale, "Chapter 16: The Rescue". It's not made clear how much time has passed, but it's likely been several months.<h2>How long did Luke train Grogu?</h2>Grogu's brief tutelage under Luke Skywalker ended in The Book of Boba Fett, and it'd be six years before Luke would begin training his official first student, Ben Solo.<h2>Did Grogu recognize R2-D2?</h2>The theory — TikToker darthjarjar suggests R2-D2 is the one who rescued Grogu from Order 66. It sounds far-fetched, but judging by R2's excited reaction upon seeing Baby Yoda, it's possible they have a history. We also know Grogu doesn't remember who saved him, which explains why the reaction wasn't mutual.<h2>Is Grogu Yoda's clone?</h2>She also sat on the Jedi Council, and appeared to share Yoda's strong connection to the Force. Most recently, there is Grogu, a child from Yoda's species. He is also extremely Force sensitive, able to use quite a few powers as an infant, like lifting a mudhorn™, Force-healing, and even on occasion Force-choking.<h2>Why can't Grogu be both Jedi and Mandalorian?</h2>Grogu Can Carry Both The Mandalorian And Jedi Ideologies<p>But Din is still bonded to Baby Yoda and intends on maintaining that relationship. So this means that Grogu will stay connected to the Mandalorians. Luke Skywalker also knows that the Jedi need to change their ways.</p><h2>Will Grogu be in Boba Fett?</h2>By the end of Book of Boba Fett, not only is that question answered, but Grogu is already back into the care of his Mando dad.<h2>Why cant Grogu be a Jedi and Mandalorian?</h2>Grogu Can Still Be A Mandalorian Jedi<p>Just because Grogu chooses the Mandalorian does not completely rule out him becoming a Jedi as well. He may not be finishing his formal training with Luke Skywalker, but then Luke himself abandoned his training initially.</p><h2>Is Anakin a Grogu?</h2>In The Mandalorian season 2, Din Djarin and Grogu's encounter with Ahsoka reveals Grogu isn't just any Force-sensitive youngling, but actually a survivor of Anakin's Jedi Temple purge on Coruscant during Order 66.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8Oim2afoqS0tnnCoaaoq5Viu7DAjK2mZpqVYq5utsSdoA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-grogu-choose-not-to-be-a-jedi.html&text=Did%20Grogu%20choose%20not%20to%20be%20a%20Jedi%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-grogu-choose-not-to-be-a-jedi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-grogu-choose-not-to-be-a-jedi.html&title=Did%20Grogu%20choose%20not%20to%20be%20a%20Jedi%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-grogu-choose-not-to-be-a-jedi.html&title=Did%20Grogu%20choose%20not%20to%20be%20a%20Jedi%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-grogu-choose-not-to-be-a-jedi.html&title=Did%20Grogu%20choose%20not%20to%20be%20a%20Jedi%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-grogu-choose-not-to-be-a-jedi.html&description=Did%20Grogu%20choose%20not%20to%20be%20a%20Jedi%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./felix-griffiths-net-worth-wiki-early-life-professional-life-awards-relationship-status-body-measurements-social-media.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Felix Griffiths Net worth, Wiki, Early Life, Professional Life, Awards, Relationship Status, Body Me">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./windows-phone-7-series-the-anandtech-guide.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Windows Phone 7: The AnandTech Guide">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
