Hormel says it stopped selling Skippy in this country due to factors like competition and pricing that hurt the brand's profitability.<h2>Does Skippy Peanut Butter need to be refrigerated after opening?</h2>SKIPPYÂ® Peanut Butterâ€”opened or notâ€”is happiest when stored at room temperature.

It has a small amount of sugar, oil, and salt added but at 1 gram of added sugar - that is not bad. Simply Jif is healthier than Natural Jif because it has less sugar and is 20% more peanuts.
