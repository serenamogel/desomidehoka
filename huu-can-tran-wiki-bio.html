Based on that information we can conclude that he was born in the year 1950. His exact date of birth is 15th August as is deduced from his immigration certificate. Tran’s Zodiac sign or Sun sign is Leo. He was born in Vietnam but later immigrated to the United States.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Huu_Can_Tran_Parents_Siblings_Education></span><strong>Huu Can Tran Parents, Siblings, Education</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tran was born in Vietnam and his parents were most probably Vietnamese. Since Tran himself is 72 years old, his parents are probably not alive anymore hence we can’t find anything about their names or their profession. It is also not known whether he had any siblings or not. His family later moved to the United States though he remains to be of Asian Ethnicity. He finished his schooling at a local high school and must have pursued higher studies at a reputed university though this information is yet to be confirmed.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Huu_Can_Tran_Immigration_Star_Ballroom_Dance_Studio_Wife_Divorce></span><strong>Huu Can Tran Immigration, Star Ballroom Dance Studio, Wife, Divorce</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Huu Can later immigrate to the United States though he initially was born in Vietnam. At that time, he used live in San Gabriel, Los Angeles, California in the United States. He was a regular patron at the Star Ballroom Studio which was a dance studio that taught and held Ball dance performances. Some sources state that he met his former wife in the same studio. Tran used to informally give dance lessons in the same studio when he first met her and offered to give her free lessons. Soon after the two started dating and got married. In 2005, Tran filed for divorce and their divorce was annulled in 2006. However, even after their divorce, Tran used to go to the dance studio almost every day in the 2010s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-2023-01-24T165156.487-300x225.jpg.webp><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Huu_Can_Tran_Mass_Shooting_Death_Investigation></span><strong>Huu Can Tran Mass Shooting, Death, Investigation</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On 21st January 2023, Huu Can Tran single-handedly performed a mass shooting with a gun. It is not known clear where he got the gun, but an investigation is going on in this field. The incident took place in Monterey Park, San Gabriel Valley, of Los Angeles County which is considered to be a Chinese enclave as it is the first City in the mainland United States with a majority of Asian Immigrants. Many people gathered in the place in order to celebrate the Chinese New Year but the Star Ballroom Dance Studio located in the same area was not part of the celebration.</p><p>From several sources, it appears that Tran spotted his wife there and started shooting which led to the death of 11 people on the spot while 9 others were injured. After that, Tran went to Lai Lai Ballroom and also shot there but no one was injured due to his poor aim. He then fled in a Cargo Van and was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot in his Van.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-99-2-300x225.jpg.webp><h4><span class=ez-toc-section id=Speculations></span><strong>Speculations</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h4><p>It is speculated that he possibly did this incident, from an unresolved domestic conflict with his former wife. Also, the Chinese community is very close to each other and is very offended when they are not invited to any kind of mass celebration. It appears that Huu Can be not invited to the New Year Celebration Party in his area which might have infuriated him. According to his wife, Tran was never of a violent attitude but he used to get angry easily. An acquaintance of Tran said that he used to say that the other dance instructors didn’t like him and used to talk evil of him behind his back. He was also very hostile to a lot of people. The case is still under investigation.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Huu_Can_Tran_Children_Height_Weight_Nationality></span><strong>Huu Can Tran Children, Height, Weight, Nationality</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Huu Can Tran doesn’t appear to have any children even though he was married for a long time.
