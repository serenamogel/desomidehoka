She knew it. She expressed it to the cameras, but not to Joey. She knew the other women were likely more expressive to him, and it could make him more confident in his relationships with them than with her. She worried it would result in her being sent home. Thus, just before Joey began <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the rose ceremony</a>, Maria asked to speak with him alone.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>That’s when she finally expressed that she was falling in love with him — even though it may have been too little, too late. Though it did make Joey think about it further before returning to the rose ceremony, her words were not enough to change his mind. He sent her home to be back with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her Beatles-like dad</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>This would be the end of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maria’s story</a> on the show, and the end of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her making questionable decisions</a> for the season, and the end of having her stuck in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">awkward situations</a>, thanks to others misunderstanding her. It would also be the end of viewers learning more about her — unless, of course, there was one more tidbit that wasn’t revealed.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>Fans of the show may have noticed that during one episode earlier this season it was noted that Maria was in a movie called The Pacifier. That seemed interesting, but we learned nothing else about it. So, I did some digging and, amongst other things, found it to be her only movie credit.<br></p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>The Pacifier was released in 2005, when Maria was just 11 years old. The Disney film stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vin Diesel</a> in an odd plot that quickly leads to him basically being a live-in babysitter for his late friend’s kids. It received mostly negative reviews, though it did extremely well at the box office.</p><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true><br>In the movie, there is what some people would consider an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unnecessary scene when Vin Diesel gets out of the shower</a>, puts just a towel on to cover his lower half, walks out to the kitchen still with only a towel covering him from waist down, and eventually realizes that one of the kids he babysits, a girl of about 11 years old, has her friends over and they all see him half naked, which earns them a chuckle. One of those friends of the girl is played by Maria Georgas.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/92DD6D4B-AE11-4E04-AD73-B1B1B2A29DDF.jpeg><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true><br>The girls are a part of what is basically a Girl Scout type of group named the Fireflies.
