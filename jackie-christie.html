Her net worth is<strong> $12 million</strong> as of July 2022.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Jackie_Christie_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Jackie Christie born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Jackie Christie was born on J<strong>uly 7, 1969,</strong> in Seattle, Washington. After finishing high school, she attended university and graduated in 1992.</p><h2><span id=Is_Jackie_Christie_Married_Relationship>Is Jackie Christie Married? Relationship</span></h2><p>Jackie Christie already had a daughter from a previous relationship when she had Chantel Christie, her first child with Doug Christie, a year after she graduated from college. Her relationship with Doug Christie ended after Ta’kari Lee (her firstborn daughter) was born. Doug and Jackie married on July 8, 1996, three years after the birth of Chantel.</p><p>Douglas Christie Jr., the couple’s second child, was born in early March 2001. According to sources, she became a grandmother in early 2017 when her second daughter, Chantel, gave birth to a baby girl named Saniyah. Jackie Christie and her family currently reside in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2><span id=How_tall_is_Jackie_Christie_Weight_Hair_Color>How tall is Jackie Christie?

She stands<strong> 1.37 meters tall</strong> and weighs <strong>63 kilograms.</strong></p><h2><span id=How_did_Jackie_Christie_start_her_Professional_Career>How did Jackie Christie start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Jackie Christie began her career as a member of the cast of VH1’s hit reality show “Basketball Wives LA,” which depicts the lives of women who are currently or have previously been romantically involved with famous basketball players. She was one of the two main characters on the show, the other being Draya Michele.</p><p>Jackie first appeared on the show as a guest in the second season, but she became a regular in season six. She was always involved in controversies on the show and was described as dominant and harsh by many of her co-stars, who even requested her removal from the series on several occasions.</p><p>Not only that, but many accused her of being a pathological liar, but Jackie remained the most visible of the show’s ladies. She also wrote six self-help/motivational books, including “Sexual Relations,” “No Ordinary Love,” “Woman,” “Proud to be a Colored Girl,” “Luv Pons,” and “In the Land of Sex & Money.”</p><p>She is the founder and CEO of Jean Fya Records, an independent record label, as well as the owner of BSM media, a lifestyle and entertainment company. In addition, in 2009, she launched her clothing line ‘Colored Girl,’ which is unique in that it is eco-friendly and organic.</p><p>This demonstrates that she has been extremely busy outside of the show and has made a name for herself in the entertainment industry. Since the early 2000s, her publishing company, ‘Infinite Love Publishing,’ which she co-owns with her husband, has had an NPO registered under it called ‘Infinite Love Foundation,’ which has been helping society in its various needs on a monthly basis.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
