Below, you’ll find my picks for the best Father’s Day gifts for any type of foodie—coffee lovers, chocolate lovers, those who love <a href=#>homemade pizza</a> or firing up the grill… Have fun looking through them! I hope you find a great gift for the dad in your life. 🙂</p><h2>The Best Father’s Day Gifts</h2><h2>1. For The Dad Who Loves to Grill: Cast Iron Grill Pans</h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1.-Staub-Grill-Pan.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>A cast-iron grill pan would be an amazing gift for any dad who loves to grill! These pans are especially great for folks who don’t own an outdoor grill…or who love grilling so much that they want to do it all year round. The cast iron evenly distributes and retains heat, so it gives food a gorgeous char just like you’d get on an outdoor grill. I love this enameled cast-iron <strong>Staub grill pan</strong> because it comes in a range of colors, is small enough for everyday use, and is super easy to wash with soap and water.</p><p>The <strong>Lodge reversible griddle</strong> is a great affordable option that has a flat griddle side and a groove griddle, making it one of the best Father’s Day gifts for the dad who wants a little flexibility.</p><p><strong>Buy the Staub Round 10-Inch Grill Pan:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$119.95 at Target</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$119.95 at Amazon</a><p><strong>Buy the Lodge Cast Iron Reversible Griddle:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34.99 at Target</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34.99 at Amazon</a><h2>2. For The Dad with Limited Grilling Space: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Weber Spirit II Grill</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2.-Weber-Grill.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>We own this <strong>Weber Spirit II Grill</strong>, and we love it because it’s perfect for grilling on smaller decks or balconies. Its compact design has a side table that can be folded down for easier storage. And though it’s small, it still features the infinity ignition propane, high performance burners, flavorizer bars, and grease management system that Weber fans swear by. There’s also a center-mounted thermometer that lets Dad check the temp with just a quick glance. Another great feature? Six tool hooks on the side keep your grilling tools within easy reach.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$449 at Target</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$449 at Amazon</a><h2>3. For The Grill Master: Grilling Accessories</h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3.-Grilling-tools.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>If Dad considers himself the family grill master, these grilling accessories are the best Father’s Day gifts around! I love pretty much anything from OXO, and the <strong>OXO Grilling Turner and Tong Set</strong> does not disappoint. The tongs are comfortable to hold and the wide head with a beveled edge glides under food for easy flipping. Plus, the stainless steel and non-slip silicone grips are rust-resistant and dishwasher safe. Gotta love that easy cleanup!</p><p>I also recommend this <strong>Char-Broil grill basket set</strong>, which I use to <a href=# rel=noopener>grill ALL the summer veggies</a>. The set includes a grill topper, round pan, and square pan, which are small enough that you can make <a href=# rel=noopener>grilled tofu</a> or <a href=#>veggie burgers</a> on the other side of the grill while you cook your veggies. With a non-stick finish, these baskets are also easy to clean.</p><p><strong>Buy the OXO Grilling Turner and Tong Set:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$17.99 at Target</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$17.99 at Amazon</a><p><strong>Buy the Char-Broil 3-Piece Grilling Topper Set:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$22.99 at Target</a><h2>4. For The Serious Pizza Lover: A Pizza Oven</h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4.-Pizza-Oven.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>At-home pizza ovens are one of the best Father’s Day gifts this year! I got the <strong>Breville Smart Oven Pizzaiolo Pizza Oven</strong> for Jack a year ago, and it’s really leveled up our <a href=# rel=noopener>pizza game</a>. It comes with preset functions so that you can make any style of pizza you like—think wood-fired, New York, pan, or thin and crispy. It gives the crust an authentic wood-fired taste with a texture that’s better than what you can achieve in a regular oven.</p><p>Our friends also have the gas-powered <strong>Ooni Koda Portable Pizza Oven</strong> and love it for backyard pizza-making. This portable outdoor pizza oven can reach up to 950°F in 15 minutes—that’s hot enough to cook a pizza in just 60 seconds!</p><p><strong>Buy the Breville Smart Oven Pizzaiolo Pizza Oven:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$999.95 at Amazon</a><p><strong>Buy the Ooni Koda Portable Pizza Oven:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$599 at Amazon</a><h2>5. For The One Who Loves A Pizza Party: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Picnic Time Acacia Pizza Peel</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5.-Acacia-Pizza-Peel.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>If you need a last-minute Father’s Day gift that Dad probably doesn’t already have, the <strong>Acacia Pizza Peel</strong> is the perfect present. The acacia wood makes for a gorgeous serving platter to display your glorious ‘za after pulling it out of the hot oven. Not only will Dad appreciate not burning his fingers, but he’ll also like the easy cleanup—just wipe it down with a damp cloth and use the hole in the handle to hang it to dry.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$29.99 at Amazon</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$39.99 at Target</a><h2>6. For The Dad Who Loves Happy Hour: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hearth & Hand Clear Plastic Ice Bucket</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6.-Ribbed-Clear-Plastic-Ice-Bucket.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>An ice bucket is essential for happy hour on the patio. This stunning <strong>Hearth & Hand Clear Plastic Ice Bucket</strong> is made from BPA-free materials, so it’s safe to use and won’t crack like glass if it takes a tumble. The clear material makes it easy to see if you need to add more ice for your next round of <a href=# rel=noopener>palomas</a>, and the metal handle makes it easy to carry.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$39.99 at Target</a><h2>7. For The Dad Who Loves to Play Bartender: Bar Accessories</h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/7.-bar-tools.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>I love this 5-piece <strong>Houdini Bar Tool Set</strong> because it has everything Dad needs to be a mixologist: a jigger, a strainer, a wooden muddler for <a href=# rel=noopener>mojitos</a>, a spoon for stirring, and a shaker. Or, to up Dad’s cocktail game even more, consider the <strong>Foster & Rye Canvas Travel Bartender Kit</strong>, which comes equipped with similar tools, plus a channel knife and ice tongs, that tuck away into a canvas roll-up for portable storage. I think it’s a truly unique gift for any cocktail lover or mixologist who has a rugged aesthetic.</p><p>If you’re just looking for a shaker, the <strong>Threshold Stainless Steel Hammered Cocktail Shaker</strong> is a stunning option. The cap doubles as a shot glass for easy measuring without taking up too much cabinet space. Plus, it’s dishwasher-safe.</p><p><strong>Buy the Houdini Bar Tool Set:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$31.99 at Target</a><p><strong>Buy the Threshold Stainless Steel Hammered Cocktail Shaker:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$39.99 at Target</a><p><strong>Buy the Foster & Rye Canvas Travel Bartender Kit:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$59.99 at Target</a><h2>8. For The Quick Cocktail Maker: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Libbey Mixologist Essentials 2-Piece Measuring Glass Set</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8.-Libbey-Mixologist-glass.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>If the dad in your life doesn’t want to fuss with a jigger and measuring cup, this <strong>Libbey Mixologist Measuring Glass</strong> will give him perfect measurements for his favorite cocktails. It also comes with a 4-ounce shot glass that has measuring lines printed on the sides in both ounces and cups to help Dad mix cocktails with perfect ratios. Pair this set with Dad’s favorite bottle of rum, gin, vodka, tequila, or whiskey for a fun Father’s Day gift!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$29.99 at Target</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$29.99 at Amazon</a><h2>9. For The Playful One: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hearth & Hand Kids’ Indoor Grilling Playset</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/9.-Indoor-Grilling-Playset.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>If Dad’s favorite way to spend an afternoon is playing with the kiddos, this <strong>Hearth & Hand Kids’ Indoor Grilling Playset</strong> would be such a fun gift! It includes 18 pretend kitchen and food accessories like a burger, corn, coasters, mustard, ketchup bottles, and more so that your little ones can “grill” alongside dad. It’s suggested for kids 2+ years old and some assembly is required. In our house, this set would be a hit with the whole family!</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$129.99 at Target</a><h2>10. For The One Frying Up Something Special: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Staub Cast Iron Fry Pan</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/10.-Staub-Cast-Iron.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>Know a Dad who loves cast-iron? There’s no better gift than a <strong>Staub frying pan</strong>. I use mine nearly every day for everything from <a href=# rel=noopener>frittatas</a> to <a href=# rel=noopener>caramelized onions</a>. The enameled cast-iron offers steady, even heat distribution for the best sear and sauté. It’s also easy to wash with just soap and water—there’s no special seasoning required!</p><p>I have both the 10- and 12-inch Staub pans. Both have the same great features: pouring spouts for draining off excess liquid and low, curved sides that make it easy to flip food. Each size comes in a range of colors.</p><p><strong>Buy the 10-Inch Staub Cast Iron Fry Pan:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$184.95 at Amazon</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$199.95 at Target</a><p><strong>Buy the 12-Inch Staub Cast Iron Fry Pan:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$219.95 at Target</a><h2>11.

We love the <strong>Yeti Hopper Flip 12 Portable Soft Cooler</strong> because it’s super durable and has superior insulation—we can keep up to 12 cans plus ice cold for hours on end. It also has a large opening so you don’t feel like you’re constantly digging through ice-cold water. It’s a bit pricey but totally worth it in my opinion.</p><p>For a budget-friendly option, I recommend the <strong>Arctic Zone Titan Deep Freezer Cooler</strong>. The 20-quart option holds up to 30 cans and keeps them cold for up to 3 days! It also has a removable shelf to keep things like sandwiches and drinks separate to prevent squishing.</p><p><strong>Buy the YETI Hopper Flip 12 Portable Soft Cooler:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$250 at Amazon</a><p><strong>Buy the Artic Zone Titan Deep Freezer Cooler:</strong><br></p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$44.99 at Target</a><h2>12.

The <strong>Baratza Encore Coffee Grinder</strong> has 40 grind settings, so Dad can grind coffee beans suited to whatever style of coffee he likes to make. Options include pour-over, French press, espresso, Aeropress, Hario V60, Chemex, and more. The grinder comes in black and white and is relatively small, so you can easily keep it on your countertop.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$149.95 at Amazon</a><h2>13. For The Pour-Over Fan: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chemex Classic Series 6-Cup Pour-Over Coffeemaker</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/13.-Chemex-Pour-Over.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>This <strong>Chemex Coffeemaker</strong> has a simple, elegant look and makes amazing pour-over coffee. It’s made of Borosilicate glass, which doesn’t absorb odors or chemical residues. Whether Dad already loves pour-over brews or is curious about upgrading his coffee routine, it would make a great Father’s Day gift. Don’t forget to grab the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">matching coffee filters</a> so he can get started right away!</p><a href=# rel=noopener>$47.03 at Amazon</a><h2>14.

It’s a cross between a pour-over and a French press, and it’s by far the best way I’ve found to make coffee when you’re camping or on the go! It packs down into a plastic mug with a red silicone lid. Inside, you’ll find a tiny spoon, a foldable stirrer to swish the grounds around, and a little case that holds microfilters, which yield a great, grit-free cup of coffee.</p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$31.95 at Amazon</a><h2>15. For The Slow Sipper: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Yeti Rambler 20-Ounce Vacuum Insulated Tumbler</a></h2><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/best-fathers-day-gifts/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15.-Yeti-Tumbler.jpg&description=The+21+Best+Father%27s+Day+Gifts+For+Foodies")'></span></span></p><p>If TikTok trends were geared toward dads, this <strong>Yeti tumbler</strong> would always be trending. It’s easily one of the most popular gifts for men! Any Dad will love this 20-ounce stainless steel tumbler for its ability to keep liquids cold or hot all day long.
