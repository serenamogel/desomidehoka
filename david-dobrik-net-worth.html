cinema room, and a large living room on the first floor, as well as a <a href=# rel=noopener>300-bottle wine cellar</a>.</p><p>Outside, because of the shady oak trees, the zero edge pool and spa are

million</strong>.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>David owns a small yet luxurious vehicle collection.</p><h4>Aston Martin</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

him the option of <strong>going to college or moving out</strong> when he finished high school.</p><p>That’s when Dobrik and a few pals <strong>moved to Los Angeles in 2013</strong>, and the group struggled to get by on inexpensive foods like peanut butter and bread.</p><p>But the tables have completely turned around!</p><p>David is best known as the <strong>head of the popular YouTube group

comes out funny.</p><p>The social media sensation is renowned for his out-of-this-world pranks on his pals, including marrying his friends’ mothers and employing fake cops to arrest his friends at a party.</p><h3>Vacations</h3><p>Despite having resided in the United States since he was six years old, the 27&nbsp; years old YouTuber is not an American citizen.</p><p>According to Dexerto, if he travels outside of the United States, he will be unable to return for ten years.</p><p>However, this does not prohibit him from traveling within the United States.</p><p>The YouTube star is frequently spotted going to Vegas with buddies and partying the night away.</p><p>Not only that, but he enjoys planning lavish trips for his friends and loved ones.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>If you know David, you

revenue</strong> from his videos.</p><p>Further, he currently makes about <strong>$2,000 each video</strong> despite having over <strong>200 million views</strong>&nbsp;because of YouTube standards to
